# Splatnet 2 Shop Search

A Google Script project that retrieves the current shop's available gear and sends an email if specified gear is found.

The script reads the current gear from the SplatNet 2 shop as it appears from an IMPORTXML function in Google Sheets. It then compares the names of the gear in the shop to an array of desired gear. If any of the names match, an email is sent notifying the user of the matching gear and abilities in the shop.
